# Edithor

`Edithor` is a minimalistic rich text editor for React. This project is created as a potential replacement for Draft.js on our [Programmer Network](https://programmer.network), and also as an excuse to build a full rich text editing experience from scratch.

This repository is by no means stable, and you should feel discouraged to use the code for anything other then learning. If you would like to help out with the project and team up, reach out.
